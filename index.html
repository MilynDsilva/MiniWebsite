Method Overloading: This allows us to have more than one methods with same name in a class that differs in signature.
An interface is a blueprint of a class, which can be declared by using interface keyword. Interfaces can contain only constants and abstract methods (methods with only signatures no body).Like abstract classes, Interfaces cannot be instantiated, they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces. Interface is a common way to achieve full abstraction in Java.
Abstract method:
1) A method that is declared but not defined. Only method signature no body
Polymorphism is a object oriented programming feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override
